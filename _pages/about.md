I am a Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University (Qatar Campus), specializing in the intersection of Computer Graphics and Machine Learning. My research focuses on two main areas: developing models optimized for learning on discrete geometric data representations (e.g., Point Clouds), and applying these models to real-world perception tasks, such as robotics in greenhouses.

I am currently supervised by [Gianni Di Caro](http://www.giannidicaro.com/), who also advised me during my senior honors thesis. I earned my BSc in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2024, graduating with university and college honors, and a minor in mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to spend a semester at CMU's main campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In addition to my research, I have a strong interest in computer systems design and implementation. In 2023, I co-designed and implemented a UNIX-like kernel that supports preemptive scheduling and provides device drivers for console, keyboard, and timer hardware. I have also worked on a variety of other systems projects, including a user-level TCP library for peer-to-peer client software, an embedded systems smart-watch concept, and an adaptive bitrate streaming server prototype.
