During my time as a CS undergrad at CMU, I have taken a wide range of courses. Inspired by [Max Slater](https://thenumb.at/cmu/), I have decided to compile my opinions on all the courses I have taken, grouped by the semesters and sorted in reverse-chronological order. Please note that all that follows is my personal view, and may not truly reflect your course experience. 



## Spring 2024

* ★ 07-599: SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis 
  * Unlike Fall 2023, Thesis ended up being my favourite "course" of the semester.
  * I managed to catch up on my thesis work, albeit a bit late than usual, but the experience taught me a lot about research, especially in ML 
  * My thesis ended up revolving around the idea of learning to sample points in a point cloud based on laplacian labels - very different trajectory from what I expected!
  * You can find a copy of my thesis [here]()

* 15-316: Software Foundations of Privacy and Security 
  * Had to take this course to satisfy my last core CS elective requirement (logic elective)
  * The course objective is to explore security and privacy from a formal viewpoint, by defining formal semantics for execution, memory access, and authorization. 
  * I am not a big fan of this paradigm, so it wasn't the most exciting CS course I have taken, but at least the assignments ended up being lightweight. 

* 21-301: Combinatorics 
  * Conceptually one of the most useful math electives for a CS major. Many of the theories you see in this course apply to a variety of CS problems
  * The idea of generating functions is very neat, but a bit trite once it comes to applying it (plug and play)
  * Sadly, I was too swamped with the thesis work so I wasn't able to put much time to deeply understand the theories.

* 70-332: Business, Society and Ethics
  * The first half of this course was very useful since I have never taken an ethics course before, so I got to learn what the terms that get thrown around mean. 
  * The assignment structure was odd, and I didn't feel like it taught me much beyond the basics. 
  * Towards the end, the course became case-study heavy, so I lost interest. That being said, one of the easiest As at CMU.
* 76-270: Writing for Professions
  * By far the most painful course of the semester, both due to its 8:30 AM timing and its repetitive content. 
  * I really, really shouldn't have put off this course till my last semester.
  * If you can, take any other course that satisfy the professional writing requirement.

## Fall 2023 (Pittsburgh)

* ★★ 15-410: Operating Systems Design and Implementation
  * The gem of Computer Systems Courses at CMU. Infamous for its notoriety. You implement an entire kernel by the end of the course! 
  * I had a love-hate relationship with this course, working on the projects was both a very fun experience but at the same time a very stress one too (almost lost an entire piece of code due to a bad merge with my partner's code).
  * Dave Eckhardt is one of the most entertaining lecturers I have encountered at CMU. He always has a story for any encounter!
  * I pass-failed the course, but I don't think I would have gotten an A either.

* ★ 57-120: Elective Studio (Voice)
  * This course was suprisingly the most fun course I took during my exchange semester. I have always had a passion for singing, and this was my first time to have a vocal instructor.
  * I chose to do the 3 unit version of the course because I wanted it to be pretty chill, so my progress was not monumental. That being said, I learned many useful techniques that I still make use of.
  * I regret not electing to do the performance at the end of the semester, but I was too swamped towards the end to not make a fool of myself on stage.

* 07-599: SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis 
  * I had a very rough beginning with my senior thesis, so the experience was quite far from enjoyable. 
  * Being on exchange made reporting to my advisor difficult, and doing research while implementing a kernel is definitely not the smartest thing to be doing. 
  * That being said, the rough beginning was a wake-up call to me, on how to properly approach research, and also how to organize my time. 
  * In an ideal world, I would have done a lot of background work in the summer leading to that semester, which would have given me the liberty to make more progress during the semester

* 33-104: Experimental Physics 
  * Unlike most, I found this course to be incredibly time-consuming and dis-engaging, and arguably one of the worst lab courses to be taken.
  * THe course had us performing experiments weekly, usually in groups, and produce *hand-written* lab reports. Those reports would be at times as long as 27 pages, and I had to pull all-nighters to wrap them up before the deadline.
  * The only remotely exciting "experiment" we did in the course was playing with, and making ice-cream out of liquid nitrogen.
  * Some people say that your experience depends on the instructor, and I have heard that [David Anderson](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/anderson.html) makes the course "more fun", so if you absolutely must take the course, maybe go for the section that he teaches.

* 82-101: Elementary French I 
  * Despite being 12 units, this course ended up being on the lighter end of my workload.
  * I took the course to satisfy a free gen-ed elective, but I would have been interested to do French II if I had a lighter spring.
  * Prof. Hoogstaden est une excellent professeur!
