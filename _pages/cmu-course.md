During my time as CS undergrad at CMU, I have taken a wide range of courses. Inspired by [Max Slater](https://thenumb.at/cmu/), I have decided to compile my opinions on all the courses I have taken, grouped by the semesters and sorted in reverse-chronological order. Please note that all that follows is my personal view, and may not truly reflect your course experience. 



## Spring 2024

* 15-316: Software Foundations of Privacy and Security 
  * Had to take this course to satisfy my last core CS elective requirement (logic elective)
  * The course objective is to explore security and privacy from a formal viewpoint, by defining formal semantics for execution, memory access, and authorization. 
  * I am not a big fan of this paradigm, so it wasn't the most exciting CS course I have taken, but at least the assignments ended up being lightweight.
