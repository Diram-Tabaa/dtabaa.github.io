During my time as a CS undergrad at CMU, I have taken a wide range of courses. Inspired by [Max Slater](https://thenumb.at/cmu/), I have decided to compile my opinions on all the courses I have taken, grouped by the semesters and sorted in reverse-chronological order. Please note that all that follows is my personal view, and may not truly reflect your course experience. 



## Spring 2024

* ★ 07-599: SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis 
  * Unlike Fall 2023, Thesis ended up being my favourite "course" of the semester.
  * I managed to catch up on my thesis work, albeit a bit late than usual, but the experience taught me a lot about research, especially in ML 
  * My thesis ended up revolving around the idea of learning to sample points in a point cloud based on laplacian labels - very different trajectory from what I expected!
  * You can find a copy of my thesis [here]()

* 15-316: Software Foundations of Privacy and Security 
  * Had to take this course to satisfy my last core CS elective requirement (logic elective)
  * The course objective is to explore security and privacy from a formal viewpoint, by defining formal semantics for execution, memory access, and authorization. 
  * I am not a big fan of this paradigm, so it wasn't the most exciting CS course I have taken, but at least the assignments ended up being lightweight. 

* 21-301: Combinatorics 
  * Conceptually one of the most useful math electives for a CS major. Many of the theories you see in this course apply to a variety of CS problems
  * The idea of generating functions is very neat, but a bit trite once it comes to applying it (plug and play)
  * Sadly, I was too swamped with the thesis work so I wasn't able to put much time to deeply understand the theories.

* 70-332: Business, Society and Ethics
  * The first half of this course was very useful since I have never taken an ethics course before, so I got to learn what the terms that get thrown around mean. 
  * The assignment structure was odd, and I didn't feel like it taught me much beyond the basics. 
  * Towards the end, the course became case-study heavy, so I lost interest. That being said, one of the easiest As at CMU.
* 76-270: Writing for Professions
  * By far the most painful course of the semester, both due to its 8:30 AM timing and its repetitive content. 
  * I really, really shouldn't have put off this course till my last semester.
  * If you can, take any other course that satisfy the professional writing requirement.

## Fall 2023 (Pittsburgh)

* ★★ 15-410: Operating Systems Design and Implementation
  * The gem of Computer Systems Courses at CMU. Infamous for its notoriety. You implement an entire kernel by the end of the course! 
  * I had a love-hate relationship with this course, working on the projects was both a very fun experience but at the same time a very stress one too (almost lost an entire piece of code due to a bad merge with my partner's code).
  * Dave Eckhardt is one of the most entertaining lecturers I have encountered at CMU. He always has a story for any encounter!
  * I pass-failed the course, but I don't think I would have gotten an A either.

* ★ 57-120: Elective Studio (Voice)
  * This course was suprisingly the most fun course I took during my exchange semester. I have always had a passion for singing, and this was my first time to have a vocal instructor.
  * I chose to do the 3 unit version of the course because I wanted it to be pretty chill, so my progress was not monumental. That being said, I learned many useful techniques that I still make use of.
  * I regret not electing to do the performance at the end of the semester, but I was too swamped towards the end to not make a fool of myself on stage.

* 07-599: SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis 
  * I had a very rough beginning with my senior thesis, so the experience was quite far from enjoyable. 
  * Being on exchange made reporting to my advisor difficult, and doing research while implementing a kernel is definitely not the smartest thing to be doing. 
  * That being said, the rough beginning was a wake-up call to me, on how to properly approach research, and also how to organize my time. 
  * In an ideal world, I would have done a lot of background work in the summer leading to that semester, which would have given me the liberty to make more progress during the semester

* 33-104: Experimental Physics 
  * Unlike most, I found this course to be incredibly time-consuming and dis-engaging, and arguably one of the worst lab courses to be taken.
  * THe course had us performing experiments weekly, usually in groups, and produce *hand-written* lab reports. Those reports would be at times as long as 27 pages, and I had to pull all-nighters to wrap them up before the deadline.
  * The only remotely exciting "experiment" we did in the course was playing with, and making ice-cream out of liquid nitrogen.
  * Some people say that your experience depends on the instructor, and I have heard that [David Anderson](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/anderson.html) makes the course "more fun", so if you absolutely must take the course, maybe go for the section that he teaches.

* 82-101: Elementary French I 
  * Despite being 12 units, this course ended up being on the lighter end of my workload.
  * I took the course to satisfy a free gen-ed elective, but I would have been interested to do French II if I had a lighter spring.
  * Prof. Hoogstaden est une excellent professeur!

## Spring 2023 

* 15-441: Computer Networks 
  * The course is well structured in terms of content, and the lectures build up on each other in a nice way (going through the all the layers bottom-up) 
  * On paper, the projects that we were supposed to implement were cool, but it was dissapointing when it came to evaluation, as the autograder was mis-configured.
  * I wasn't a big fan of the theory homeworks or the quizzes, but they exist for a reason I guess.

* 21-355: Princples of Real Analysis I
  * The course was a bit of a bore during the first half because we kept talking about sequences for a good while.
  * Towards the end, it got interesting with the proofs of differentiability and Reimann Integrals. 
  * If you plan to take this course, I suggest taking Real Analysis II as well, to have the full picture. 

* 15-330: Introduction to Computer Security
  * Relatively much easier than networks, despite being 12 units as well. 
  * The course is divided into three segments: systems security, crypto and web security. 
  * My interest in the material fluctuated based on the topics, as I wasn't a big fan of crypto. 
  * That being said, all of the homeworks were very fun to work on (bomb lab on steriods, breaking crypto systems, breaking into a website payment system)

* ★ 79-293: Inward Odyssey
  * Despite being a humanity course, it ended up being my favorite course of the semester. 
  * I cannot emphasize enough how engaging are Ben Reilly's lectures -- the students are running the show more often than not!
  * The readings were also very unorthodox for a history course, you get to read about travellers throughout history and their encounters with other nations.

## Fall 2022 

* ★ 11-485: Introduction to Deep Learning 

* ★ 15-348: Embedded Systems

* 15-451: Algorithm Design and Analysis

* 85-370: Perception

## Spring 2022

* ★★ 15-251: Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science
  * GTI is by far one of the most well-structured and well-taught courses at CMU.
  * The first half of the semester is admittedly a review from other courses, but eventually you get to the bulk of thought-provoking topics in CS.
  * Many great ideas (pun intended), including but not limited to: Finite Automata, Turing Machines, Reductions and P vs NP.
* ★ 15-210: Parallel and Sequental Data Structures and Algorithms

* 16-311: Introduction to Robotics

* 36-218: Probability Theory for Computer Science 

## Fall 2021 

* ★★ 15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems

* ★ 82-119 Arabic Calligraphy Culture and Skills

* 15-150: Principles of Functional Programming

* 21-300: Basic Logic 



## Spring 2021

* ★ 15-458: Discrete Differential Geometry 
  * I found out about this course by accident, and I was unsure if I wanted to register for it or not, but looking back I am glad I did.
  * This course was an interesting outlook at graphics from the side of geometry processing, more precisely taking all the descriptions and operations that you do on differential surfaces (smooth surfaces that are locally euclidean), and trying to descretize them for computer simulation.
  * The course consisted of only doing written homeworks and programming homeworks, and the grading was pretty lenient overall (you can chose to not do an entire homework)
  * Keenan Crane has one of the best lecture slides and supplemental materials I have ever used for a course.
* ★ 21-259: Calculus in 3D

* 02-251: Great Ideas in Computational Biology

* 15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation

* 76-101: Interpretation and Argument

## Fall 2020


* ★ 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and CS 

* 07-129: Freshmen Immigration 

* 21-127: Matrices and Linear Transformations

* 76-100: Reading and Writing in an Academic Context

* 99-101: Computing @ Carnegie Mellon
